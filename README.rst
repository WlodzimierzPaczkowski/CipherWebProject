Main idea of this project is to learn how to make backend of web app in spring, using spring boot and create small cryptography system, and opportunity to break them/ guess key


Right now there are two views, that just show html web with injected value with @Value()

TODO DONE ``make all injected value in application.resource``

TODO ``add cesar cipher class``

TODO ``learn more of java, spring, crypthography``

TODO ``format READ.ME``

TODO ``Put this project on Docker``

TODO ``Add database, maybe MongoDB, and put some dummy data there``

TODO ``Make this project take data from external API, serialize it and put into database``
