Main idea of this project is to learn how to make backend of web app in spring, using spring boot and create small cryptography system (first one will be cesar cypher), and opportunity to break them

Right now there are two views, that just show html web with injected value with @Value()
TODO make all injected value in application.resource
TODO add cesar cipher class
TODO learn more of java, spring, crypthography
TODO format READ.ME
